\begin{abstract}
VAMDC contains  a great ammount of spectral line data, that could be made more
accessible from VO Applications with  VO protocols. This document proposes a mapping
between VAMDC metadata and SSLDM (Simple Spectral Line Data Model) metadata.

\section{Introduction}

SLAP (Simple Line Access Protocol) is the VO standard for Spectral Line querying. 
SSLDM (Simple Spectral Line Access Protocol) is the VO data model for spectral lines.
There are very few working services in the VO that use this protocols, meaning that the
amount of spectral line data in the VO is small. 
On the other side, VAMDC services offer a great amount of spectral line data, and 
so it's desirable to access this data in a VO-way (simple). 
The queries to the VAMDC services might be simple, however, the data returned is much more
than the necessary data for simple use.
A proposed mapping would translate the VAMDC output into the  VO data model (SSLDM). Some metadata that are not contained in SSLDM can also be retrieved, if useful. 
Which parameters  will be mapped are defined by the use cases.

\section{Use Cases}

In most use cases, the goal is to search for spectral lines within a wavelength range:

\begin{itemize}
\item all spectral lines 
\item spectral lines from a specific atom (or molecule)
\item spectral lines from a specific ionisation level
\item spectral lines with specific (other) parameter

\end{itemize}

\section{Mapping}

The following parameters have been mapped. This mapping is implemented in SPLAT-VO.
